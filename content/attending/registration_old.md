The deadline for **early registration is March 31, 2024** and the **late registration deadline is May 22, 2024**.

## Information for Authors

Each paper accepted to the main conference program (AAAI proceedings) must be accompanied by registration and payment of either regular fee or student fee. It is up to the authors to decide who will be the presenter and will pay the registration fee. **One author registration fee may cover up to 2 of their papers**.

Physical attendance and in-person presentation is expected for each paper. In extraordinary cases, on-line presentation will be allowed. In such a case, the author needs to provide a valid reason and get approval from conference chairs. This still requires regular/student registration fee for the paper.
